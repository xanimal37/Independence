# Independence 

## Description
When parents get older they can reach a place where they are semi-independent. For example, they may still be living in a house but need a lot of help, either visits from relatives or maybe a part-time caregiver. It can be difficult to figure out when to take additional steps in their care, how much help they really need. Communication and reminders can be difficult. This app is intended to help both elderly and their caregivers communicate better and create data that can aid in decision-making and planning. Today, most elderly people do fine on their phones, as long as apps aren't too complicated. The phone (and laptop or desktop computer) could be a useful tool for communication. 

One concern with an app like this is HIPAA data. This will be addressed with Spring Security but is probably an incomplete solution (this is a demo).
